# Easter Project -- OSX setup script

by Stephen Smithwick

This project is a small gist to install all the dependencies that I usually need on a new osx install.

Download and install/update:

echo "Fetching Easter Project:"
```bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://gist.githubusercontent.com/StephenSmithwick/59cb017eeedc9396cd94/raw/setup.bash)"```
