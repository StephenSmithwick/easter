# Easter Project -- OSX setup script

by Stephen Smithwick

This project is a collection bash scripts which install all the dependencies that I usually need on a new osx install.

Download and install/update:

```bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StephenSmithwick/easter/master/fetch.bash)"```
